# Create - Fabric Edition
This is a port of Shimibub's create mod, check the License section below for more information.

This port's goal is to bring the create experience to fabric, I have no plans to add more content in this mod that isn't present
in the original, however if enough people want to produce addon mods an api could be produced to have compatibility between this mod and others.

All pallette blocks have been added and unique blocks such as the copper blocks etc. will have their features full filled.
Logistic blocks, contraption blocks etc. will be added as placeholders in the coming days, and hopefully I can slowly develop
a system/interface for all of them to use and we can be one step closer to seeing this become a reality.
I still have lots of things to add to the mod, so please be patient with any new features/blocks/items etc. that need to fixed
and added.

I work on this when ever I can in my free time.

Thanks for any support you provide!

****
Big disclaimer I reset my pc twice recently and so I lost a lot of progress i made on a direct port. The mod is extremely diffuclt for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience porting/coding such a massive mod. I may revist this someday but as of 4/9/2020 I'm going to move onto other projects because this is particularly difficult 
and will most likely need a lot of maturity in the Fabric mod ecosystem to become viable.

P.S. if anyone wants to help the mod develop go ahead and send some commits my way, I might update this later today to have the main dev repo of Create and start the direct forge port again and in that case I'm going to need as much help as possible with rendering code etc. that I don't currently understand.
