# Create - Fabric Edition
This is a port of Shimibub's Create mod, check the License section below for more information.

This port's goal is to bring the Create experience to fabric, I have no plans to add more content in this mod that isn't present
in the original.

This port is going to require a lot of work now that it is using the raw code of the original mod instead of having the functionality written.
Render code will probably be a big hurdle and making replacements for where the forge api does its job will also be difficult.
One of the few reasons that you might consider porting this mod is 

1. it is relatively close to vanilla in terms of scope and 
2. it doesn't have any other dependencies besides forge, and it's api.

Another goal of mine is to make this mod as compatible with other mods as possible. 
I work on this when ever I can in my free time so no expected release dates oe anything.

Thanks for any support you provide!
