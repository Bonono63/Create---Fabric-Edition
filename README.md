# Create - Fabric Edition
This is a port of Shimibub's create mod, check the License section for more information.

This port's goal is to bring the create experience to fabric, I have no plans to add more content in this mod that isn't in the original without an addon mod, making any extra changes and additions optional to the user.

Currently this mod has little with only basic materials available, but in the coming days expect to see some tooltips and some features adapted from the original.

Thanks!
